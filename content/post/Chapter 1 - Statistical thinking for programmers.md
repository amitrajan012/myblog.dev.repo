### 1.1 Do first babies arrive late?

<b>Anecdotal Evidence </b> is based on data that is unpublished and usually personal. For example,
<i><center>"My two friends that have given birth recently to their first babies,
BOTH went almost 2 weeks overdue before going into
labour or being induced.‚Äù </center></i>
Anecdotal Evidence usually fail because of <b>Small number of observations</b>, <b>Selection bias</b> (People who join a discussion of this question might be interested because their first babies were late.), <b>Confirmation bias</b> (People who believe the claim might be more likely to contribute examples that confirm it) and <b>Inaccuracy</b>.



### 1.2 A Statistical Approach

Limitations of Anecdotal Evidence can be addressed by using the tools of statistics, which include <b>Data Collection</b>, <b>Descriptive Statistics</b>, <b>Exploratory Data Analysis</b>, <b>Hypothesis Testing</b> and <b>Estimation</b>.

### 1.3 The National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG)

NSFG is a <b>cross-sectional</b> study (it captures a snapshot of a group at a point in time). The alternative is a <b>longitudinal</b> study which observes a group repeatedly over a period of time. The people who participate in a survey are called <b>respondents</b>. Cross-sectional studies are meant to be <b>representative</b>, which means that every member of the target population has an equal chance of participating. NSFG is deliberately <b>oversampled</b> as certain groups are sampled at higher rates compared to their representation in US population. Drawback of oversampling is that it is hard to arrive at a conclusion based on statistics from the survey.

```python
live_births = pregnancies[pregnancies['outcome'] == 1]
print("Number of live births is: " + str(live_births.shape[0]))
mean_first = live_births[live_births['birthord'] == 1]['prglength'].mean()
mean_other = live_births[live_births['birthord'] != 1]['prglength'].mean()
print("Mean Pregnancy length for live births of first babies is: " + str(mean_first))
print("Mean Pregnancy length for live births of other babies is: " + str(mean_other))
print("Difference in Mean Pregnancy length for first and other babies is : " + str(mean_first - mean_other))
```

    Number of live births is: 9148
    Mean Pregnancy length for live births of first babies is: 38.6009517335
    Mean Pregnancy length for live births of other babies is: 38.5229144667
    Difference in Mean Pregnancy length for first and other babies is : 0.0780372667775

</br>

### 1.5 Significance

From the above analysis, it is evident that the difference in mean pregnancy lengths of first and other babies is <b>13.11 hours</b>. A difference like this is called an <b>apparent effect</b> which means that there must be something going on but we are not sure yet. If the difference occurred by chance, we can conlcude that thet effect was not <b>statistically significant</b>. An apparent effect that is caused by bias, measurement error, or
some other kind of error is called <b>artifact</b>.
